    <text>
      <text>This is a short, and hopefully comprehensive version of the ToS, directed to the publicThe Terms of Service of Mantaro Bot ("Agreement") is between Mantaro (or "the service") and you ("user" or "the end user").Kodehawa (and the other developers of Mantaro) has developed a Discord(tm) Bot ("the bot" or "Mantaro") in connection with the Discord(tm) API ("the Platform").By using the bot in any way or triggering the use of its systems you agree to be bound by this Agreement to all of its extent.This might be changed, prior warning, at any time.By using the bot, either by accessing its commands or using any of its features, you affirm that you have read this agreement, understands it and agrees to be bound by it. TL;DR: You assume responsibility for streaming copyrighted material, cheating/botting is absolutely prohibited and might end up in all of your data being deleted without warning, and you agree to all the terms of this agreement</text>

Mantaro is designed to provide functionality when, and only when, it's added to a Discord(tm) guild ("server"). 1.2. Support: Support is provided only on the support server, in a 'first-come-first-serve' basis. Support via any other means is NOT in any way official. 1.3. General Statement: Mantaro is a service provided for free, without ANY GUARANTEES, and it's a beta product, which might contain bugs. We appreciate your understanding on that regard.</text>

Services: The music streaming services provided by the bot are subject to change, without prior notice and in any case. 2.3.

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Terms Of Service, 3. Use of the Mantaro "currency" and game system [Legal]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>3.1. Data: You agree that all data you provide to the bot through commands and that specifically or implicitly means it will be saved forever, on a database located on a remote location.The information is highly confidential and won't be sold or used by any other purpose that's not specific to the functionality of the bot. 3.2. Usage and cheating/botting: Cheating and/or botting (using self-bots/user-bots/macros/auto-clickers on your account to gain unfair advantage) are completely prohibited. If you're caught botting or cheating on any of the currency commands your profile is on a high risk of being deleted from the database completely without warning. https://discord.com/terms Keep in mind this could get you banned from Discord as well as this is also against their ToS. 3.2.1. Macros: Keyboard macros are disallowed if they perform more than one command per keypress. If you have a macro to do /chop and then you have to press enter then that's ok, but if you do one that does "chop -> enter -> mine -> enter -> loot" then that's NOT okay, and it's considered botting. I get bored with typing /mine too sometimes, but don't run multiple commands with a single key press! That'll just get you flagged. 3.3. Re-incidences: If the end user continues to cheat on the games/currency commands, the account will be terminated, its data deleted without prior warning and the end user will be blocked from using the bot. 3.4. Appeals: It's possible to file a full appeal with the reasons on why you want to be unblocked from using the bot by sending an apology letter regarding the following points:The reason of why you cheated Why you won't cheat again Why should we trust you. 3.5. Money transfers: It's NOT allowed to exchange credits for real money. If you're caught doing this your profile is on a high risk of being deleted from the database completely without warning. This also comes into play if you're in a server who does that kind of transaction. This includes Discord Nitro trades, as some people just tend to send the money through PayPal. Anything that involves any kind of real money is utterly and completely prohibited. 3.6. Account deletion: We will delete your account and all the data associated with it on request, done through the support guild or by sending a DM to Kodehawa#3457. 3.7. Trading for other bots credits: This is usually considered a gray area and not encouraged. You're better off not doing this if you don't want to risk your account under any circumstances.</text>

    <text>
      <text>This page is used to inform users of Mantaro regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use Mantaro.TL;DR: We don't collect much. We support your freedom and don't use Google Analytics. Feel free to read down.If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as strictly needed to operate the service or required by law (and I don't think the law will want a bunch of numbers with a number identifier, to be fair).The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible here, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy. Information Collection and Use We only collect the data you give us through the bot usage. Exceptions to this include levels and other passive methods of gaining levels, like the amount of times you've been claimed.Personally identifiable information:Welcome messages and such are only stored for the purpose of actually giving the welcome message and nothing else. Same goes for all of the data you give the bot, which is only used to provide the service you need.We might collect your date of birth, which you have to give the bot by yourself if you want to have your birthday set. There's no need to set it otherwise.We save your data securely and the user identifier is the unique user ID (snowflake) Discord gives you.Anything stated here can be reviewed on the https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot source. If we missed something important, scroll down to the "contact us" area and let us know. Log Data We might log the command being used by the user on debug logs for the purpose of fixing issues. We also log if someone has been caught spamming, the server where they were caught spamming, and the cause of them hitting the spam filter.We do not collect any personal information, except for your date of birth, which you have to give the bot by yourself if you want to have your birthday set. This can be removed at any time. Website The website is literally a static page with no code except markdown https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io (I'm not kidding, source here), so you can be sure we do not put Google's analytics or whatever analytics method people use now.We do have Cloudflare's analytics, but that's because the page is routed through Cloudflare to prevent DDOS attacks. Children's Privacy Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions. Changes to This Privacy Policy We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page. We probably won't add anything evil, so don't panic. This is just legally required.

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Faq, Remember that for the most up to date FAQ you want to check the FAQ channel on our discord server. [Intro]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>1.- How do I change the prefix for this bot? You can change the prefix in this bot using ~>opts prefix set &lt;prefix> , where &lt;prefix> would be replaced with whatever you desire it to be. Keep in mind that for technical and convenience reasons the prefixes ~> , -> and mantaro will always work and cannot be disabled.You can also mention the bot in replacement for a prefix. 2.- What is premium and what is the Patreon bot? Premium is a status that can be applied to both servers and users and provide perks like no music length limit and more. You can obtain premium keys by becoming a Patreon. The Patreon bot is however essentially a second Mantaro that runs on a different server, causing better Music quality. It is also the bot to receive new features first providing you with an insight of what is to come. You can read more info about premium, the Patreon bot and PayPal and Patreon donations in https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Premium-Perks this page. 3.- How does EXP in Mantaro work and what use do levels have? While levels do not serve much of a purpose right now they kind of give you an idea of how active someone is on discord (within servers that Mantaro is also in). To gain experience you simple send messages in any server with Mantaro. Spam won't work, there's a 30-35 seconds ratelimit between it counting messages. Every counted message counts towards 1-8XP and commands/interactive operation stuff won't gain you experience. 4.- Some of Mantaro's commands are not showing any content (empty message), for instance on help? Make sure that within your https://i.imgur.com/BhTarjg.png user settings you have https://i.imgur.com/8TV4qn0.png "Link Preview" enabled, as that is necessary to be able to see embeds. If that does not help the server you are on might have disabled Embed Links as a permission. If however neither is the case feel free to report it in #support, to gain assistance or insight as to why that's happening. 5.- The bot is not responding or lagging behind what do I do? There really isn't much that you can do besides wait. We will usually announce issues within this guild as soon as we become aware of them. In most cases this is just a temporary hiccup within discord and should resolve itself. 6.- Mantaro joined a VC but she isn't playing anything/she is lagging There are a couple of troubleshooting steps that you can follow to fix this.Make sure that Mantaro has perms to both see and talk in the VC you are using. Make sure that Mantaro is not muted be it server mute, a role that mutes her or by you having lowered her volume on Discord to 0 before. 2.1) If someone has premium in the server/the server is premium, check the ~>volume command to make sure her volume is not 0. Check the video that you are trying to play and/or try a different video. Sometimes Youtube videos get muted for copyright reasons, or they are region locked which could make it so Mantaro can't play the video. Change server region. To do this go into Server Settings and then pick any other region that is not the one you are currently using. If after all of this Mantaro is still not playing anything then it would mean that there is either an issue with Mantaro or a third party issue that goes out of our hands. If you get to this point then please let us know. 7.- What do the items within Mantaro do? How to earn credits? What are waifu's and how to raise my waifu value? We have a detailed wiki explaining all of these questions. Simply visit our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Currency-101 Currency-101 page and have all of them and more answered. 8.- Can I add money to people in my own server/s server that I admin? Short answer: no you cannot. Long answer: All of Mantaro's currency related features are on a global scale, allowing you to summon money from no where would tip the scale. 9.- What is the Birthday announcer? Why are my birthdays not being announced? Can I set other people's Birthday? We have a detailed wiki explaining all of these questions. Simply visit our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Birthday-101 Birthday-101 page and have all of them and more answered. 10.- Can I unclaim people who I no longer share a server with or that show as unknown user? (Waifu command) You can unclaim them using their Discord ID (not username#xxxx), you can get access to those by invoking the following ~>waifu -id . Then you would simply put their ID in place of the mention ( ~>waifu unclaim ID ).In the event that a user shows as unknown under your waifu list: You will be provided their user ID as their name, regardless of if you invoke with -id or not, and can do the above using that ID however you will have to append -unknown to the message i.E: ~>waifu unclaim ID -unknown 11.- When trying to waifu claim a user it says they are locked? How to get rid of claim keys? When a user is "locked" that means they have prevented themselves from being claimed by another user. To turn this off the locked person needs to use ~>profile claimlock remove . 12.- What is dust? Dust is something you will accumulate every time you, well, find dust in any command. At 97% it will prevent you from doing ~>cast until you clear your dust using a mop that you can buy from the market ( ~>useitem mop ). 13.- How do I change my Profile description? You can change your description at any time using ~>profile description set &lt;text> . 14.- What are love letters? What are they used for? How do I get one? Love letters are given to each person upon marrying using ~>marry . They can be used to create a love letter between those people (only the proposer may do so) using ~>marry createletter &lt;text> . ​ 15.- How do I make a custom action command like ~>hug? You would use something like this: ~>custom new action v3:@{if;$(event.message);usermention;@{embed;description:"$(event.author) is using an action on $(event.message)",image:"https://mrlar.dev/i/5NCuLZswrZgqHq5.png"};You need to mention a user!} Where you replace the URL with an URL to an image of your choice and the text with any text of your choice. You can use multiple images by using the above statement with custom add instead of custom new repeatedly, it will add multiple reponses and pick one at random. 16.- Mantaro has deleted all my roles/channels/banned all my user/or similar Before reporting it here make sure the action was taken by the real Mantaro. To identify the real one you check one of 3 things, though it is best to check them all.Check if the Username is exactly the same as the real one no weird letter that looks the same but is different. Check if the discriminator (numbers after the # in the username) is 4454 Check if the ID of that Mantaro is 213466096718708737 (You can view IDs by going to your user settings > appearance > developer mode > right click user > Copy ID) If one or none of the above are identical you have likely fallen victim to a fake Mantaro. And while we feel deeply sorry for it there is not much we can do about it. You can help prevent this sort of stuff by reporting it to the https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new Trust and Safety team. They will need as much proof as you can provide.To be absolutely safe never invite a bot called "Mantaro" if any of the above things are altered. A real invite will always direct you to https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=213466096718708737&amp;scope=bot +/- the permission bit. 17.- How do I invite the bot? My server does not show when inviting the bot? (Or anything related to inviting the bot) You can invite the bot over at https://add.mantaro.site/ this link it will redirect you to Discords authorization page. For this to work properly you will have to make sure that you are logged into the right account on the web version of discord (No, being logged into the desktop/phone app does not guarantee this). To double check this you can head to https://discordapp.com/app discord's web version. If you are logged into the right account you may choose a server in the dropdown, you may also modify the permissions we add by default, though if you are unsure it's best to leave them as is. After hitting authorize the bot will join the chosen server.If the server you are planning to invite the bot to does not show that can mean 1 of 3 things. Either the bot is already on the server, you are not logged into the right account after all, or you do not have Manage Server permissions. In the event of none of those 3 applying contact https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new discord support.In the event that you invited the bot and it does not appear on the server there is a high chance someone else is kicking it (There seems to be bot's around who automatically kick other bots). 18.- What is "Old Sparkle Pickaxe" and can I restore/use it? You cannot. This is a replacement item for an old bug and it does not serve a purpose and never will. You can dump it. 19.- I have been blacklisted from using the bot. What do I do? Can I be unblacklisted? Chances are you will not be unblacklisted due to you likely having used external scrips to use currency. You however may send a polite and detailed appeal to Kodehawa on contact@mantaro.site (No an appeal is not is not "I won't do it again", neither is some obviously made up story). You will have to patiently wait for him to reply, if he never does that means you will not be unblacklisted. If Kodehawa says no, there is no point in begging. No means no. Kodehawa is the only one who can unblacklist you and will not be taking any direct requests for being unblacklisted. You need to send the email. Complaining about not having received warns will reduce your chance of being unblacklisted to effectively 0. We do not give warns, this is how zero tolerance policies work.You may read our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Terms-of-Service Terms and Service before appealing to see if appealing will actually serve any purpose. 20.- I am trying to cast an item but it is not working? Chances are you need to type the name of the item/wrench in quotes (i.E Star Pickaxe -> "Star Pickaxe"). If you don't type it on quotes it won't work. If you are using a normal wrench (the one bought from the market) you don't need to specify it on the command. 21.- I have lost my daily can I get it back? No, there is no actual way for us to refund a daily. And if you have lost it there is probably a very good reason why you did. For instance using the daily command right after another command (which fucks with our data). Users have a time frame bigger than 24 hours to claim their daily. For more detail refer to https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/issues/258 issue #258. 22.- I just donated and I want to know how to add Mantaro Patreon or get my premium keys If you donated via Paypal then please get in contact with Kodehawa#3457 so that he can give you the corresponding rewards. If you donated via Patreon then first make sure that you have linked your Discord account to your Patreon account (check https://support.patreon.com/hc/en-us/articles/212052266-How-do-I-receive-my-Discord-role- here for more help). After this Mantaro will attempt to DM you your first key (make sure you have open DMs for this). After this same as with Paypal, contact Kodehawa#3457 if you wish to get any other rewards. 23.- Can I buy credits in Mantaro? Do I get credits for donating/pledging? Is there any way to obtain credits/items/badges using real money? We do not exchange Money for credits within Mantaro (or Mantaro Patreon for that matter) what so ever. Please do not ask this here. Anyone spreading that we do offer "Money for Credits" is spreading a false rumor. It is true that, that used to be a thing in the very first version of currency (which is now over 2 years ago), but it no longer holds true and never will anymore. Additionally all credits that were ever given for real money (which was only through patreon pledges) were also reset with the big reset after said currency version (We mention this here mainly for the sake of transparency and to clear up any misunderstandings).Additionally we also forbid people from offering credits for real money on their own (This is part of our Terms of Service, reachable on github).TL;DR: There is absolutely no way to obtain credits through donations/pledges or the use of real money. 24.- I want to request my data / I want to delete my data Send a formal request to contact@mantaro.site and we'll process it as soon as possible. Data deletion is irreversible and leads to a permanent blacklist from the bot to ensure we don't collect any further data about you, so only do it if you're sure about it.Data requests will be processed in 1 to 7 days. Keep in mind the data won't be human-readable. It only includes Player / User / Seasonal data, NOT guild data. We need proof you're the owner of the data before processing it, so ping me before sending the email. 25.- I used the waifu optout option, is there a way to reverse it/optin? Short answer: No, you cannot optin after you optout. This is final. Long answer: The optout option is very heavy on our system. Since it forces an user to be unclaimed from all users, we need to check all users, and theres a lot of users. Not only that, unclaim usually takes money but since this forces you to be unclaimed, you can do it for free. These things mentioned before can be abused if we allowed users to opt in/out as they wish.As well, since it was introduced we have not allowed people to optin. Due to fairness to others this will remain the same.</text>

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Premium Perks, Claiming and Using your Perks [Intro]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>How do I claim my rewards. Mantaro should automatically Direct message you a single Premium key if you Donated via Patreon and joined the Support server. To get additional keys (if you pledged more than 1$) just poke us on the #donators channel in the support server and we will create them for you. To use a key on yourself simpyly do /premium activate key:&lt;key> with a user key (you can give the key to someone else and they can use that command aswell), to make a server premium just do /premium activate key:&lt;key> with a guild key in that server. If you donated via paypal simply poke us and we will create the proper amount of keys for you. Donation methods Patreon: http://patreon.com/mantaro Paypal: https://www.paypal.me/kodemantaro Note: To allow the patreon bot to join a server we will need that guilds ID (unique identifier). You don't know how to get those? Easy. Go to the server settings. Browse widget and copy the server ID. Alternatively you can if you have the normal Mantaro already just run the /info server command and copy what you see in the footer. If none of that applies: go to your Discord appearance settings and enable Developer Mode then right click the server icon and click "Copy ID".</text>

will NOT work again.

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Welcome And Leave Messages, Using Modifiers [Configuration]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>So first of all. What are modifiers? Basically modifiers are what you can use to tell the message to for instance mention the user that joined. You can view all modifiers https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Custom-Command-Modifiers#modifiers-for-welcomeleave-messages here. For the sake of this tutorial we will only cover $(event.user.mention), $(event.user.username), $(event.guild.name) and $(event.guild.totalusers).So, let's say you want to mention the user that joined. Tell him how many users your server has with him/her joining and also include the server name for simple aesthetics. For this you would do something like. ~>opts usermessage joinmessage Welcome to $(event.guild.name), $(event.user.mention). You are our $(event.guild.totalusers)th member! null https://i.imgur.com/7nGWxjr.png image To break this down.$(event.guild.name) is replaced with the name of the server.$(event.user.mention) is replaced with the mention of the user that just joined.$(event.guild.totalusers) is replaced with the total member count of the server including the person that just joined.Now let's say you want to do something similar for the leave message. We will use: ~>opts usermessage leavemessage $(event.user.username) just left $(event.guild.name). Current Members $(event.guild.totalusers). null https://i.imgur.com/fuyNDjq.png image Now that you understand modifiers let's move to the final level.</text>

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Welcome And Leave Messages, Using Embeds [Configuration]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>You can also use embeds in Welcome and leave messages (Just that the command is different for leave message of course but you learned that already). To use an embed you will need to know how to work with them. To start you will need to start off you message with embed: followed by one or more of these:title:"text" description"text" thumbnail:"image url" image:"image url" fields:[{name:"name here", value:"text here"}, name:"name", value:"text here", inline: true, .....}] color:"hex code or member" footer:"text" footerImg:"image url" author:"text" authorImg:"image url" Ok, yes this is complicated so let's make an example: ~>opts usermessage joinmessage embed:author:"Welcome to our server", authorImg:"https://i.imgur.com/VoVaJ0K.png", title:"Please enjoy your stay :>", description:"Please be sure to read our rules carefully thanks~", image:"https://i.imgur.com/fjmcMHL.jpg", thumbnail:"https://i.imgur.com/KYblACB.png", color:"c91191",footer:"Server owned by MrLar", footerImg:"https://i.imgur.com/R5MoVC5.png" Setting it up &amp; in action: null https://i.imgur.com/68xlljt.png image This will need a lot of practice.

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Welcome And Leave Messages, Combining your knowledge [Configuration]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>Ok so you learned how to use embeds and modifiers. What about both in one? (Please note that using mentions in the title, footer, field names, author and some other places will not work and display them how they look internally to discord. This is a discord limitation that we cannot do anything about.) ~>opts usermessage joinmessage embed:author:"Welcome to $(event.guild.name)", authorImg:"https://i.imgur.com/VoVaJ0K.png", title:"Please be sure to read our rules carefully thanks~", description:"Please enjoy your stay $(event.user.mention)", thumbnail:"$(event.user.avatar)", color:"c91191",footer:"Server owned by $(event.guild.owner.username)", footerImg:"$(event.guild.owner.avatar)" null https://i.imgur.com/3aBjQIh.png image Another way of combining what you know is by using both plain text and embeds. It may sound complicated but it is not. All you have to do is write whatever you want as plain text and then follow it with an embed, like so: ~>opts usermessage joinmessage Welcome to $(event.guild.name) embed:authorImg:"https://i.imgur.com/VoVaJ0K.png", title:"Please be sure to read our rules carefully thanks~", description:"Please enjoy your stay $(event.user.mention)", thumbnail:"$(event.user.avatar)", color:"c91191",footer:"Server owned by $(event.guild.owner.username)", footerImg:"$(event.guild.owner.avatar)" null https://i.imgur.com/pqXQund.png image</text>

      <text>You can also add multiple leave and welcome message. Since this basically works the same way as this entire tutorial we will not make any visuals for it. The only change is that you use ~>opts usermessage joinmessages add &lt;message> for adding another welcome message and ~>opts usermessage leavemessages add &lt;message> for adding another leave message. In order to remove a message that you added you will need to first get a list of them ~>opts usermessage joinmessages list &amp; ~>opts usermessage leavemessages list and then use the number displayed next to the one you want to remove in ~>opts usermessage joinmessages remove &lt;index> or ~>opts usermessage leavemessages remove &lt;index> respectively.This of course also works in the leave message!

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: Birthday Announcer, What is the Birthday Announcer? [Configuration]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>The Birthday Announcer is a function in Mantaro that allows her to send a birthday message to celebrate someone's birthday. Mantaro will send a message in the specified channel for each user and will provide them with the specified birthday role for that day. Important commands /birthday set date:&lt;dd-MM> Allows you to specify your birthday (dd-mm format). ~>opts birthday enable &lt;channel name> &lt;role name> Allows you to set up the Birthday Announcer. ~>opts birthday message set &lt;message> Allows you to set a Custom Birthday Message. /birthday allowserver Allows your birthday to be announced in the server you use this command on. Other/Extra commands ~>opts birthday disable Removes the Birthday Announcer. ~>opts birthday test &lt;@mention> Allows you to test the Birthday Announcer. ~>opts birthday message set &lt;message> Allows you to set a custom message for you Birthday Announcer. ~>opts birthday message clear Removes the custom message you had and restores the default message for the Birthday Announcer. ~>opts commands birthdayblacklist add/remove &lt;@mention> Allows you to blacklist an user from having their birthday announced on the server. Important information You cannot add someone else's birthday for them. Every user needs to add their own birthday themselves. The list of users to announce each day is cached every 24 hours. Meaning that any changes to ones birthday will not be reflected until after the cache happens. Since changes are not reflected until after the cache happens, this also means that if a birthday is added before the actual day then it won't be announced. For example, if your birthday was June 6th and you add it on June 5th it will not be announced since it was not cached. Users need to use /birthday allowserver if they want their birthday announced. If they don't use the command it will not be announced. Birthdays are announced at midnight America/Chicago time. This is a global setting and cannot be changed.</text>

    <text>
      <text>Before enabling the birthday announcer you need to check some things first.You need to choose a channel in which Mantaro will announce the birthdays. You need to choose a role to be assigned on each birthday.* *Make sure that the role you choose is not a role with permissions you would not want all users to have. As well, make sure that the role is not an actively used role, for example a role called Member that is given to everyone is not a good choice.Once you have those two you can use ~>opts birthday enable &lt;channel name> &lt;role name> to activate the Birthday Announcer. null https://i.imgur.com/c1T9vAd.png image Once again there's a couple of things to keep in mind.You have to type the name of both channel and role. Do not mention them. If your role name has spaces on it (it's not a single word) then you have to type the name in quotes. "Just like this" If your role/channel name has special characters on it know that Mantaro at times does not recognize them and will fail the command because of them. You can rename the role so it does not have special characters, setup the announcer and then rename your role back.</text>

    <text>
      <text>You can change the default message sent by Mantaro on someone's birthday. The messages do not support embeds, meaning you will only be able to use plain text for them. To set them up you need to use ~>opts birthday message set &lt;message> . You have two modifiers at your disposal for birthday messages: $(user) This will return the name of the user. $(usermention) This will return a mention of the user. $(tag) This will return the user tag. For example Kodehawa#3457. To use them you just have to type the modifier wherever you want it to be in your message. null https://i.imgur.com/eoM44Qg.png image Important things to keep in mind:Do not start the message with a new line! Put the message right after ~>opts birthday message set , like ~>opts birthday message set Hello there . If you use a new line (aka ctrl + enter before the actual message), you'll get an error message. You cannot mention @everyone. This is intentional. The size of your message is limited by Discord's own message limit (2000 characters - 26 characters from the command - 2 characters from the default prefix (this one can vary if you have a custom prefix)).</text>

      <text>Custom commands support what's called modifiers, which are a set of predetermined custom command actions which might make your commands spicier and better. A list of those can be found https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Custom-Command-Modifiers here, so here we will see examples on how they work. The most useful ones are:$(event.author.mention) Mentions the person who executed the command. $(event.me.mention) Mentions mantaro. $(event.message.raw) Basically you can use this to make a ~>say command. Repeats what's after the command. $(event.channel.mention) Mentions the channel the command was executed on. $(event.channel.topic) Says the channel topic. $(event.guild.name) The name of your server. $(event.guild.owner.name) The server owner's name. $(event.guild.region) The server region. Basically, you can use those in any form of command.To create a command with those modifiers just create a command and use those. ( https://i.imgur.com/HBbUZzt.png Example). Works with multiple responses too. There is only one noticeable difference in v3. The difference is that you can basically set up your own modifiers per command. What that means is that you can define a value that you can then call using its modifier. And example of this would be: null https://i.imgur.com/GdmaZYk.png image</text>

      <text>You can also automate playing music and claiming/unclaiming self-assignable roles.If you want to create a music shortcut your content will have to be play:&lt;url to song> . Mantaro will then act as if you were using the play command with this url when you run the command.If you want to make the command assign an existing iam role your content will have to be iam:&lt;name of the iam role> If you want to do the opposite and you want the command unassigned an existing iam role you will have to put iamnot:&lt;name of the iam role> . In both cases Mantaro will act as if that person did ~>iam &lt;name of the iam role> and ~>iamnot &lt;name of the iam role> respectively if they run the command. You can also specify your own custom message if you would like to, this works in both v3 and v2. The v2 syntax for this would be iamcustom:&lt;name of the iam role> "&lt;message>" (same for iamnotcustom:). The v3 syntax for this is @{iam/iamnot;name of iam role;message} where the message is optional, meaning you can use iam roles in v3 now, and that combined with embeds, texts, ifs and so on.

      <text>What is new with this in v3? The syntax has changed from embed:&lt;json> to @{embed;&lt;json>} .Additionally, you can now use embeds and normal text at once. For instance This is text @{embed;title:"Hi"} would both display the text "This is a text" and the embed with the title Hi. You will need to add v3: before any of the command's contents for this to work as in this example: null https://i.imgur.com/VGwGhwl.png image What is an Embed? Okay let's start by making a simple embed. First let's look at what an embed even is: null https://i.imgur.com/PqSsAMG.png image title:"your text here" - Will set what you see as "Title Text" in the image above. description:"your text here" - Will set what you see as "Description". thumbnail:"valid image url here" - Will set the top-right image. image:"valid image url here" - Will set the big bottom image. author:"your text here" - Will set what you see as "Author Name". authorImg:"valid image url here" - Will set the image you see next to "Author Name". footer:"your text here" - Will set what you see as "Footer text" footerImg:"valid image url here" - Will set the image you see next to "Footer text". color:"hex code/color name here" - Will set the color of the purple strip you see on the left. fields:&lt;field sytanx (check slightly below)> - For this one the syntax with [] and {} is important. As-well as you need at least a value and a name in each {}. Name will set what you see as "Field name" and value what you see as "Field value", inline will determine whether the field will be in a separate line (like the first one in the image) or next to an existing one. Inline can be either true or false or be omitted entirely. Field Syntax: [ {name:"name of the first field", value:"value of the first field", inline:true}, {name:"name of the second field", value:"value of the second field", inline:false} ] How to use an embed in custom commands? Please pay close attention to the character limits in the image above as-well as the maximum amount of fields. Exceeding those will make your custom command fail! You do not have to use all of the things above you can create your own combinations of them as you like. Additionally please note that title , author , field names and footer do not support any form of mentions due to discord limitations.Our syntax for the custom command will have to be @{embed;&lt;json>} . With "json" being any assortment of the things you learned above. For instance: title:"text",description:"text" . (Note the comma between 2 variables)As an example we will build the embed above using Mantaro. We will be using this as content: v3:@{embed;title:"Title text (256 chars)", description:"Description (2048 chars, Character limit for the **entire** embed is 6000)", fields:[ {name:"Field name (256 chars)", value:"Field value (1024 chars, Max 25 fields)"}, {name:"Inline", value:"Field", inline:true}, {name:"Inline", value:"Field", inline:true} ], author:"Author Name (256 chars)", authorImg:"https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/302810118335102976/88bc9d0aa3e196aba1fa4403956027ae.png", thumbnail:"https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/302810118335102976/88bc9d0aa3e196aba1fa4403956027ae.png", footer:"Footer text (2048 chars)", footerImg:"https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/302810118335102976/88bc9d0aa3e196aba1fa4403956027ae.png", image:"https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/302810118335102976/88bc9d0aa3e196aba1fa4403956027ae.png", color:"c91191"} In action: null https://i.imgur.com/oPs5t44.png image</text>

Available comparators equals : As seen in the example above will check if the thing to compare equals the thing to compare with. not-equals : Same as equals but reversed*. ignorecase-equals : Same as equals but ignores casing (i.e A == a). ignorecase-not-equals : Same as ignorecase-equals but reversed*. greater-than : Whether or not the thing to compare is greater than what the thing to compare with is (i.e 2 > 1). less-than :Whether or not the thing to compare is less than what the thing to compare with is (i.e 1 &lt; 2). not-greater-than : Same as greater-than but reversed*. not-less-than : Same as less-than but reversed*. ignorecase-greater-than : Same as greater-than but ignores casing. ignorecase-less-than : Same as less-than but ignores casing. ignorecase-not-greater-than : Same as not-greater-than but ignores casing. ignorecase-not-less-than : Same as not-less-than but ignores casing. contains : Whether or not the thing to compare includes the thing to compare with. not-contains : Same as contains but reversed*. starts-with : Checks if the thing to compare starts with the thing to compare with. ignorecase-starts-with : Same as starts-with but ignores casing. ends-with : Checks if the thing to compare ends with the thing to compare with. ignorecase-ends-with : Same as ends-with but ignores casing. * Note: Reversed means logically reversed i.E contains checks if it is in the thing and not-contains checks if it is not in the thing. Predicting Predicting is the act of checking whether or not something meets a predicate. In simpler terms this can be anything like checking if a value is empty or checking if it's equal to a preset value.The syntax for if-else for this one is @{if;thing to predict;predicate;if met;if not met (else)} . You can additionally use the test operation to assert a boolean, uses for that are in the Asserting section down below. Syntax for this is @{test;predicate;value to predict} Available Predicates usermention : Check if the thing you check is a user mention. is-empty : Checks whether the thing to check is empty (aka has no characters). is-not-empty : Same as is-empty but reversed*. * Note: Reversed means logically reversed i.E contains checks if it is in the thing and not-contains checks if it is not in the thing. Asserting (True and False) Asserting a boolean means anything that returns a true or a false. We have mentioned the compare and test operations up above, both of these will when used outside of an if give you a "true" or a "false" as a message. However these truth values can be used in if commands to make more complex structures.The structure for if-else changes drastically for this one. It is as follows: @{if;if met;assertive;if not met} This all comes with very handy logical operators: @{and;operation;operation;....} : This can be used to only return true when all operations passed assert to true. @{or;operation;operation;....} : This can be used to return true when any of the operations passed assert to true. @{not;assertive} : This can be used to negate an assertive, meaning a true will become a false and vice versa. Operations You have a handful of operations to choose from, while we already talked about most of them, here is a list of all: @{if;syntax} : Used to make conditional responses, it's syntax is dependent on how it is used and all syntax are explained in the respective sections for predicting, comparing and asserting. @{not-empty;argument1;argument2;....} : Returns the first value that is not empty (You can feed this unlimited arguments). https://i.imgur.com/KRLgId2.png Example (Note: this does not ignore values that are only a space) @{not-empty-strict;argument1;argument2;....} : Same as not-empty but also considers values that are only a space to be empty. @{set;key;value} : Explained in detail in the Modifiers section up above @{embed;embed syntax} : Explained in detail in the embeds section up above @{compare;syntax} : Explained in detail in the comparing section up above @{test;syntax} : Explained in detail in the predicting section up above @{and;syntax} : Explained in detail in the asserting section up above @{or;syntax} : Explained in detail in the asserting section up above @{not;syntax} : Explained in detail in the asserting section up above @{timestamp;format;zone} : Used to print a time/date in any format you like from any timezone you like. Format is a bit more complex an example would be: d MMM uuuu , for the current date (more info for format on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html Java Docs, the time zone can be any of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones these TZ database names (include every character even underlines). @{upper;text} : Used to convert a text to fully uppercase @{lower;text} : Same as upper but with lowercase @{replace;character(s) to replace;replace with;replace in} : Used for replacing occurrences of characters in a text. Example would be @{replace;r;test;$(event.message)} to replace all r's with test in event.message What do we get in v3 vs old v2 You can now nest ifs (i.E use a new if as else of another to create chains)! You can now use embed fields in ifs You can now use newlines in ifs You can now check whether or not something contains a discord mention You can now chain if's (use multiple ifs in the same command) and have their else actually work. In general you can use all conditions/special syntaxes anywhere in your command. Meaning you can have text with an embed etc Generally a far more in depth and detailed interaction with if-else due to the high amount of operations available</text>

    <text>
      <text>Mantaro has an extensive currency system. At times, new people don't know where to even begin. The purpose of these pages is to steadily introduce a few concepts and commands needed to progress while using the currency system.These pages are merely an explanation of concepts and commands in an order we believe is easy to understand for progressing. It is in no way the "correct", the "best" or the "only" way of using Mantaro. It is up to every user to decide themselves what they want to do with the system.

    <text>
      <text>Global Currency Mantaro's currency system is global. What this means is that your progress/items/credits/etc are the same across all servers. This means that something like spawning credits or items with a command is not possible, as it would throw the currency system into complete chaos. Credits The currency used in Mantaro is called Credits. The main purpose of the currency system is to collect Credits. Credits are necessary for many of the purchases in the currency system. Items Mantaro counts with over 100 items for users to collect and use. Some items are only meant to be collected, other items can bring bonuses to the user and other items can enable certain commands. A full Item Documentation page can be found https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation here. It is not necessary to know all items or to look into this page, but know that it can be a good resource in the future. Dust Sometimes a few of the currency commands will "fail" and won't give you credits or items. A lot of those times you will gather dust instead. A few commands gather dust when successfully used. When starting out, dust shouldn't be one of your main concerns until later on. If your dust levels are high enough then you will not be able to cast new items until you clean your dust, but more on that later. Help Command This one is very important. If you ever feel lost or don't remember how a command works, you can check that command's help to get the information without having to open this wiki. To get a commands help you can use /help command:&lt;name of command> . Additionally, the command /help will show you the full list of commands. You can also check our Command Documentation page https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Command-reference-and-documentation here. Premium influence Premium status for users influences the currency in very specific ways, and we will probably mention it a few times in the next pages. However, there is more that premium can do. For the sake of not making this wiki any longer you may view what premium does https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Premium-Perks here.</text>

      <text>Regarding External Software, Macros, etc. (Cheating) If you have been caught using any external software, Macros (yes Macros are cheating) or similar you are breaking our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Terms-of-Service Terms of Service and https://discordapp.com/terms Discord's Terms of Service. Very notable is that automating your user account in any way using Discord API wrappers is a very bannable offense by discord. ( https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-user-accounts-self-bots- Context)You will be blacklisted from using the bot and reported to discord in major cases. In minor cases you will be blacklisted from the bot and you may send a polite appeal. An appeal is not simply saying you won't do it again.In very rare cases you may be blacklisted from the bot for being a huge d*ck to Developers or Staff. In even rarer cases you may be blacklisted from the bot when you have been blacklisted on other bots. Regarding Exploiting bugs If you are caught exploiting major bugs in Mantaro to gain an advantage we will reset your profile entirely. Depending on the situation you may even be blacklisted. Not reporting a major bug after having found it may cause us to misinterpret things. Your best bet is to simply report them. If you have reported the bug and accidentally used it multiple times, you are fine. However, intentionally using it multiple times is still a no-go despite reporting it. Regarding selling/buying stuff for real money Under no circumstances are you are allowed to sell/buy anything related to Mantaro for real money (this includes crypto currency of any kind). This is to prevent scams. If you are being offered a trade like this report them immediately and do not trade with them. Falling for a scam like this will be faced with no support. You have been warned.Offering such trades is a permanent blacklistable offense.</text>

    <text>
      <text>There are many ways of getting credits in Mantaro. However, we believe that the following commands are good places for you to get started. Daily The command that's most likely to be your first currency command is /daily , which you can run every 24 hours for a base of 150$. However, if you run daily consecutively every 24 hours your streak will increase eventually gaining your more money up to a cap of 1000$ as well as a random crate every multiple of 20 and a Magical Watch every multiple of 50. Failing to collect your daily for 48 hours results in your streak getting reset to 0. You can also give the money to someone else (will not affect your streak) yielding them ever so slightly more. To do so simply mention them while running the command. null https://i.imgur.com/shjAPTz.png image Loot Loot is another command which can be used to gain easy credits. You can run it using /loot every ~5 minutes which can yield credits and/or items (more credits than normal when a user is premium). In certain conditions you can even find unique items. Take a look at our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation Item Documentation page if you want to find out what exact drops you can get. null https://i.imgur.com/qL5URi8.png image Market The market is the place to go for buying or selling your items. For starters, you can use /market buyable to bring up a list of all the items you can buy. You can use the arrow reactions to navigate through the different pages. null https://i.imgur.com/YYzvgxr.png image To buy items you use /buy &lt;amount> &lt;item> . To sell items you use /sell &lt;amount> &lt;item> . null https://i.imgur.com/NxrkDA2.png image null https://i.imgur.com/8549gts.png image Additionally, you can use /market price item:&lt;name> to view a specific item's sell and buy price. You can also get rid of items completely (for instance if they can't be sold) with /dump amount:&lt;amount> item:&lt;name> . Profile Your profile is your main point in the currency system. It will display your top items, your balance and a bunch more. To view your profile simply use /profile show , or to check someone else's profile use /profile show user:&lt;mention> . You can also right-click on someone's name, then click on Apps and finally on Show currency profile to also see their profile. null https://i.imgur.com/a2bOfRn.png image Your profile has many things you can customize. Here's a few of them:Description: To change your description around you can use /profile description description:&lt;your description> . Display Badge: To change your display badge you can use /profile displaybadge badge:&lt;badge name> . Of course, you need to have the badge you want to display, but we'll get into that later. Timezone: To change your timezone you can use /profile timezone timezone:&lt;your timezone> . Widgets: This option is https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Premium-Perks Premium only. With this you can change around the order of how things show up on your profile, or keep them from showing up at all. Use /profile widgets to get the instructions on how to use it. Birthday: To change your birthday you can use /birthday set date:&lt;dd-MM> . You can also view all sorts of stats involving your activity in Currency using /profile stats . Finally, you can change the language in which Mantaro answers you using /profile language lang:&lt;language code> . Use /mantaro language for more information. Balance Here is where you can check out your current balance. While your balance also shows up in your profile, sometimes you just want to check without all the other information showing up. To check how many credits you have on your balance use /balance . null https://i.imgur.com/Q7ReRVW.png image Inventory Here is where you can check out all your items. Your profile will only show your top items, so here is the place to check all those items you have. To check your item list use /inventory show . If you want a simpler version you can also use /inventory brief . null https://i.imgur.com/DWz7k77.png image</text>

    <text>
      <text>The commands you just learned will help you get started out. However, they won't be enough for what's to come. For that, the next thing to learn is about tools. There are many tools available, each with different tiers, but for now we will focus on the 3 most basic tools: pickaxe, fishing rod and axe. Name Icon [{text=Brom's Pickaxe, type=SimpleText}] [{text=Fishing Rod, type=SimpleText}] [{text=Axe, type=SimpleText}] These 3 basic tools are always available for you to buy at the market. As you progress you will be able to create better tools. Durability Most tools at your disposal have a durability value. As you use your tools, this value will continue to drop until your tool breaks. Durability changes across each type of tool and its different tiers, meaning better tools have more durability. When your tool does break it will disappear. However, if the tool that broke has a broken item version, then you have ~80% chance of getting the broken version back. Not all tools have a broken version.After equipping your tools (see next section), you can check their durability by using /profile stats . null https://i.imgur.com/n8OdRl1.png image Equip and Unequip To keep going forward first off you will need to equip your new tools. To equip one of your tools you can use /equip item:&lt;tool name> . null https://i.imgur.com/bO0vPk7.png image If you want to unequip one of your tools you can use /unequip item:&lt;tool type> . Do bear in mind that the durability of the item you are unequipping comes into play here as well. If your item has not been used (has 100% durability) you will recover your item when unequipped. However, if you have used the item then two things can happen:If the tool you are unequipping has a broken version, then you will get the broken version back. If the tool you are unequipping doesn't have a broken version, then the tool will be lost, and you will get back some credits instead. null https://i.imgur.com/AdD7GPF.png image Mine Required Tool: Any Pickaxe.When you use /mine you will go mining to get credits and/or items. The better the pickaxe you use the more credits you will get, and the better chances you will have of finding items. Some items can only be found depending on the quality of your tool. Each time you mine you will get anywhere from 1 to 4 Mining EXP. Take a look at our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation Item Documentation page if you want to find out what exact drops you can get. null https://i.imgur.com/bwmSGau.png image Fish Required Tool: Any Fishing rod.When you use /fish you will go fishing to get credits and/or items. The better the fishing rod you use the more credits you will get, and the better chances you will have of finding items. Some items can only be found depending on the quality of your tool. Each time you mine you will get anywhere from 1 to 4 Fishing EXP.

The better the axe you use the more credits you will get, and the better chances you will have of finding items. Some items can only be found depending on the quality of your tool. Each time you mine you will get anywhere from 1 to 4 Chopping EXP.

    <text>
      <text>If you've been following so far, you have been using the default tools bought at the shop. They don't have a lot of durability, and their chance of getting items isn't that great. As you might have figured out by now, there are better tools available for you to use. In this section we'll try to teach you about these tools and how to get them.First things first, the different tool tiers. Not all tools have every single tier (meaning some skip a few tiers), but the order should still be the same.Default tools Diamond tools Comet tools Star tools Moon tools Sparkle tools Hellfire tools Each tier requires different materials to be created. The better the tool, the rarer the material. Some tools allow you as well to get items you were not able to get before. As well, the better the tool you use, the better the drop rate for items.Sparkle Fragments () can only drop if you use a Star tool or better. Shells () can only drop if you use a Comet tool or better. Sharks () can only drop if you use a Sparkle tool or better. Casting Before you start casting items you will need a new tool, a wrench. As with the previous tools, wrenches have different tiers. Different tiers are needed to cast different items, so you will need them eventually. Wrenches are different from other tools in that you don't need to equip them. Instead, you specify the wrench you want to use when you cast something. Name Icon [{text=Wrench, type=SimpleText}] For now go to market and get yourself a few of the default wrenches.You need to equip your wrench with the /equip command, just like you equip your pick, rod or axe.Casting is the main way in which you will be getting these new tools. You can start by viewing a list of all castable items with ~>cast list . Check out the items and look at the recipes and prices of each of them. To cast the item you can use /cast item item:&lt;name> . For example, /cast item item:Comet Gem . null https://i.imgur.com/HBAvCxH.png image If you have a better wrench than the default one (which you can cast) you can also equip it to cast Items for cheaper as well as multiple items at once. To cast multiple items at once, put the amount before the item name (For example, /cast item item:Star Pickaxe amount:5 ).As we mentioned before, remember that if your dust level is too high you won't be able to cast. We explain how to clean your dust a bit further on the Potions section. If you don't know how to get an item then take a look at our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation Item Documentation page if you want to find out where exactly you can find the items you need. Repairing Sometimes when your tool breaks you will get a broken version back. With the repair command you can repair your broken tool to use it once again. Just as with cast, you will need a wrench to use this command. However, the default wrench from the market won't be enough, so cast yourself a better wrench before repairing. First off, check out the list of repairable items and their recipes with /repair list . You need to equip your wrench with the /equip command, just like you equip your pick, rod or axe. If you have one equipped, you don't need to worry.After you found the recipe to repair your broken tool you can use /repair item item:&lt;name> Salvaging Sometimes you don't want to spend resources repairing a tool, or you simply don't have them. In those cases you might want to consider salvaging your tool. When you salvage a tool you randomly get back one of its components. First off, check out the list of salvageable items and their possible drops with /salvage list . To salvage an item you can use /salvage item item:&lt;name> . You can use any wrench tier to salvage items. Remember to have it equipped.</text>

    <text>
      <text>By now you may be wondering if all these items you are collecting have any use at all, and the answer to that is: yes, some of them do. A full list of the items with actual uses (minus the ones needed for recipes) can be found https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation#usableconsumable-items here. However, in this page we won't cover all the usable items, only a few of them. Potions While not all the items we will cover here are "potions", they fall under the same category. First off, use /use list to see the items used in the use command. All the items we'll list here are used with /use item item:&lt;name> . You can use several items at once with ~>use item item:&lt;name> amount:&lt;amount> . Name Icon Use/Description [{text=Haste Potion, type=SimpleText}] [{text=Allows you to collect more stuff from currency commands for 2 sessions., type=SimpleText}] [{text=Milky Potion, type=SimpleText}] [{text=Clears all potion effects., type=SimpleText}] [{text=Energy Beverage, type=SimpleText}] [{text=Makes a tool lose less durability per swing.

Lasts 3 sessions., type=SimpleText}] [{text=Fishing Bait, type=SimpleText}] [{text=Gives you a higher chance of catching fish., type=SimpleText}] *For potions that affect drop rates: These will affect the drop rate of all items minus Sparkle Fragments. Crates If you were lucky (or if you have https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Premium-Perks Premium and used /dailycrate ) then you might have already found a Crate. Crates are rare drops from some currency commands. When you open them you will get random items depending on the type of crate you open. To open a Crate first your need to buy a Crate Key from the market. After that you can use /opencrate crate:&lt;name of crate> to open the Crate. If you are still having trouble, go to our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation#crate-items Item Documentation page you can find a section with all the Crate types and their specific commands.</text>

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: 101: Intermediate knowledge, Credits - More money commands [Currency]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>You are probably wondering if there are any other ways of getting credits aside from the ones you have already learned, and yes, there are. In this section we'll try to teach you a few other commands that may be useful on getting more credits. Some are relatively safe, and some are more on the risky side. Transferitems/Transfer Chances are, unless you are alone in a server with a bot, there are other people in the server with you. In those cases you can work together with friends, trade items and/or credits with them to reach your goals. To transfer items you can use /transferitems user:&lt;mention> item:&lt;name> amount:{amount} . null https://i.imgur.com/t1mgh3y.png image To transfer credits you can use /transfer user:&lt;mention> money:&lt;amount> . null https://i.imgur.com/mnUI1nZ.png image Note on the Transfer command: Due to a previous iteration of the currency system that had several bugs, credits became heavily inflated. People were abusing this, and we had to introduce a transfer tax. Not long ago from the time of writing this (November 27, 2020) we performed a Currency reset to try to fix this issue. However, people still found ways to abuse the systems we have. For this reason, we decided to leave in the credit tax. As well, we made it so that you cannot transfer credits to or from a new Discord account. We also limited the max amount of credits you can transfer to 500,000 and increased considerably the ratelimit of the Transfer command.While these measures may disappear or be changed in the future, we feel the need to explain why they are there in the first place. We thank everyone for their understanding. Games Mantaro offers 3 types of games which can each earn you some credits. All the games below (except trivia) can be started using ~>game &lt;type> . You can start multiple instances of a single game using ~>game multiple &lt;type> &lt;amount> . You can start multiple games in a lobby using ~>game lobby &lt;types> for instance ~>game lobby pokemon, trivia . You can play with people by simply mentioning them at the very end of the command. Trivia Unlike the other game commands, trivia can be used with ~>trivia or ~>trivia &lt;difficulty> where difficulty can be easy, medium or hard. However if you want to play multiple instances after another or have it be part of the lobby you would still refer to the above. (Note that appending the difficulty works on multiple and lobby as well using -diff &lt;difficulty> )Trivia is essentially a game of answering the asked question. The difficulty you pick will determine how many credits you get. You get 2 attempts to solve normal questions and one for true and false questions. Due to technical limitations you may not specify a category. Pokeguess (Who is that pokemon) You can start this game with ~>game pokemon . Pokeguess is a simple game of being shown a silhouette of a specific pokemon (and sometimes a very specific form of it). You then get 4-5 attempts to guess the pokemon correctly. If you do, you will be rewarded a handful of credits. Number You can start this game with ~>game number . This is by far the hardest game. You will be asked to guess a number between 0 and 150 within 5 attempts and 30 seconds. You will get hints whether the number is lower or higher than you last guess. Guessing right will reward you a handful of credits. Character You can start this game with ~>game character . In this game you will be shown an anime character. You then get 4-5 attempts to guess either their full name, or their first name. Guessing correctly will grant you a handful of credits. Gamble Gamble is arguably the best for making fast money however it does come with a risk. The odds are not in your favor You can initiate a gamble by using /gamble amount:&lt;amount> . The minimum amount is 100 credits, and the maximum is 10,000 credits. You can also type "all", "half" or "quarter" for the respective amount of your total credits (Assuming it falls in the range of credits given before). With a bit of luck you get to keep what you bet and win some extra credits, if you are out of luck you lose it all.\ Slots Slot is very similar to gamble however it has a higher chance of winning at the cost of a lower reward. You can roll the slots using /slots credits:&lt;amount> . The minimum amount is 25 credits, and the maximum is 50,000 credits. You can also make use of slot tickets which you can buy from the market. You can however not combine tickets with credits and vice versa. Tickets can be used by issuing the command like so: /slots useticket:True or ~>slots useticket:True ticketamount:&lt;amount> for multiple.</text>

      <text>This section is to mention a few commands that are part of the currency system, but do not give credits or items. Reputation Reputation is basically just a number that you can be proud of. Every 12 hours you can give someone 1 reputation point using /reputation user:&lt;mention> . You cannot give reputation to yourself. Your reputation counter does not affect you in most situations. It can serve as bragging rights, or to get you ranked on our leaderboards (which we'll cover later). You can check your reputation on your profile. null https://i.imgur.com/lm0MsQq.png image Badges While using Mantaro's currency you may stumble across the fact that you have earned badges. Badges essentially are achievements. Some are easy to get, some a hard to get. Some even are tied to riddles, and you won't know how to get them based on other people's badge list. To check your badges use /badges show .

You can switch between the two types by using /pet choice (for marriage pet choice, use /pet choice marriage ). A personal pet is the default if you don't have a marriage pet already at the time of update 6.2For marriage pets you need to buy a marriage Car and House ( /marry car and /marry house ). To do this you need to have a house and a car on your inventory.The next requirement is for you to have a Pet House. You can buy one from the market.

    <fullTitle>Mantaro Wiki: 104: Advanced knowledge, Waifus [Currency]</fullTitle>
    <text>
      <text>The waifu system of Mantaro basically allows you to "claim" (please note that this does not imply any relationships or real life events) users for whatever they are worth. Why would you care? Well, the only real reason to care is either the Waifu Pill item mentioned before, or to show off how expensive the people you "own" are. It is however noteworthy that you cannot sell waifus, and unclaiming them actually requires you to pay money. They are also are not unique to you, one user can claim a user you already claimed. How do you claim a user? This is actually rather easy you simply type /waifu claim user:&lt;mention> . You will then spend the money that user is worth to claim them. This will occupy a slot. By default, you have 3 slots. You can buy up to 20 slots using /waifu buyslot .You can list the waifus you have claimed at any time using /waifu list . How do you unclaim a user? It is almost as easy as claiming a user if you still share a server with said person. You simply have to type /waifu unclaim user:&lt;mention> .In the event that you do not share a server with a user you claimed anymore you will have to obtain their unique identifier (ID) which is not the numbers after the # in their user handle. To find out their ID use /waifu list id:True . This will show you your usual waifu list, but it will also include the ID of each waifu. After that simply use /waifu unclaim id:&lt;id> . How do I check someone else's waifu value and how do I raise my own? To check your own or someone else's waifu value you can simply type /waifu stats for your own or /waifu stats user:&lt;mention> for someone else.In this menu you will see so-called "weight values", and a reputation multiplier along your total performance points and your total value. Your performance and value can be raised by increasing any of the weight values and or gaining more reputation (please note that a reputation multiplier below 1 gets treated as 1). For instance to raise your badge weight you would have to gain more badges. To raise your claim weight you would have to have yourself get waifu claimed and so on. This also means your total value can drop if any of these values decrease (the only ones that actually can decrease is money and claim).</text>

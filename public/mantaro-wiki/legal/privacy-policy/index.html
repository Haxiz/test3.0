<header><h1>Information Collection and Use</h1></header>
<p>This page is used to inform users of Mantaro regarding our policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use Mantaro.Note: TL;DR: We don't collect much. We support your freedom and don't use Google Analytics. Feel free to read down.If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as strictly needed to operate the service or required by law (and I don't think the law will want a bunch of numbers with a number identifier, to be fair).The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible here, unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.We only collect the data you give us through the bot usage. Exceptions to this include levels and other passive methods of gaining levels, like the amount of times you've been claimed. Personally identifiable information: Welcome messages and such are only stored for the purpose of actually giving the welcome message and nothing else. Same goes for all the data you give the bot, which is only used to provide the service you need.We might collect your date of birth, which you have to give the bot by yourself if you want to have your birthday set. There's no need to set it otherwise.We save your data securely and the user identifier is the unique user ID (snowflake) Discord gives you.Anything stated here can be reviewed on the https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot source. If we missed something important, scroll down to the &quot;contact us&quot; area and let us know.</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Log Data</h1></header>
<p>We might log the command being used by the user on debug logs for the purpose of fixing issues. We also log if someone has been caught spamming, the server where they were caught spamming, and the cause of them hitting the spam filter.We do not collect any personal information, except for your date of birth, which you have to give the bot by yourself if you want to have your birthday set. This can be removed at any time.</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Website</h1></header>
<p>The website is literally a static page with no code except markdown https://github.com/Mantaro/mantaro.github.io (I'm not kidding, source here), so you can be sure we do not put Google's analytics or whatever analytics method people use now.We do have Cloudflare analytics, but that's because the page is routed through Cloudflare to prevent DDOS attacks.</p>
</article>

<article>
<header><h1>Children's Privacy</h1></header>
<p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian, and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.</p>

<article>
<header><h1>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h1></header>
<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page. We probably won't add anything evil, so don't panic. This is just legally required.</p>

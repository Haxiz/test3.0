# What are badges?

Badges are basically achievements that you can gain. Badges will show on your profile in the order shown below.
Additionally, the Badge icon of your highest badge will be drawn onto you profile picture in the embeds
thumbnail.

Note: *Almost all to all badges are applied to you after doing `~>profile` so use that first and then the `~>badges`
command.*

| Revelation                      | A gun as a weapon, a chessboard as a world, passing through universes and flying through emotions.                          |

| Luck Behind                     | A one-in-six chance of counting the tale, maybe slightly too much, maybe slightly too little.                               |

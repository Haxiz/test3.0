**Description:**\
The moon-like substance mesmerized you.\
Was it the fact it glowed like a full moon, or was it the fact it seemed to float on its own?\
Regardless, you tried to fuse this with your current pick, and the result was quite satisfactory.\
Seems to be a good balance between light and dark, and somehow I mine some gems with it.\
Is this really a fragment from a far away moon?

**Description:**\
Something made you look up into the caverns, and you found a sparkly gem on top. Looking up, some fell onto your pick, and it made the pick shine enough to light up the entire cavern.\
Quickly, you grab some of the sparkly fragments and get a casting station.\
The pick glows bright like the sun... and it seems pretty tough too... how did it fuse so well with iron?

It seems to be a mix of all the other elements, but it seems quite reactive... it's also quite tough, not much seems to be able to break it...\

A touch of sparkle here, a touch of sparkle there!\
You pulverized the Sparkle Fragments and coated the thread of your fishing rod with it.\
You seem confused. How can this attract fish?\
The world has many mysteries, and this is one of them. Maybe it can help you get more coins. Maybe it can bring you satisfaction.\
The glow it leaves on the sea is amazing, and you stare at it for hours on end. Maybe you did do the right thing after all.

**Description:**\
Looking at this axe, you look mesmerized by moon-like glow it emits.\
Was it the fact it glowed like a full moon, or was it the fact it seemed to float on its own?\
Mesmerized, you cast this substance into your axe and... boom!\
The results look good. It seems to chop trees faster, too. Why is it so sharp? Is this really a fragment from a far away moon?

**Description:**\
Reactions between all the elements can be a weird and dangerous process.\
You mastered the elements already, and fusing it with your axe now seemed trivial. Maybe it was the glow, maybe it was the fire, but you had to do it.\
It works wonders. Nothing can compare. But you're still left wondering whether you really did the right thing.

# Claiming and Using your Perks

## How do I claim my rewards.
Mantaro should automatically Direct message you a single Premium key if you Donated via Patreon and joined the Support server.
To get additional keys (if you pledged more than 1$) just poke us on the #donators channel in the [support server](https://support.mantaro.site), and we will create them for you.

To use a key on yourself simply use `/premium activate key:<key>` with a user key (you can give the key to someone else, and they can use that command as well), to make a server premium just use `/premium activate key:<key>` with a guild key in that server.
If you donated via PayPal simply poke us, and we will create the proper amount of keys for you.

## Donation methods
* Patreon: http://patreon.com/mantaro
* Paypal: https://www.paypal.me/kodemantaro

Note: To allow the patreon bot to join a server we will need that guilds ID (unique identifier). You don't know how to get those? Easy. Go to the server settings. Browse widget and copy the server ID. Alternatively you can if you have the normal Mantaro already just run the `/info server` command and copy what you see in the footer. If none of that applies: go to your Discord appearance settings and enable Developer Mode then right-click the server icon and click "Copy ID".

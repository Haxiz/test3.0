However, a few commands may not work if the corresponding permission is missing."],["commands@@permissions@@managing-commands","Commands","Permissions & Managing","Managing commands","Slash Commands Permissions Due to the nature of Discord Bots that use Slash Commands, the bot automatically obtains most permissions pertaining to messages (Embed links, Attach Files, etc.). However, there are still some permissions that must be manually given be it to the user or to the bot. These include, but may not be limited to, \"Use External Emotes\" and \"Manage Messages\".Warning: All non-message permissions, if required, are not obtained automatically. Disabling/Managing Slash Commands (Integration settings Method) As for access permissions, these can be handled using the integrated Discord https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4644915651095-Command-Permissions Command Permission System. This can be done in a few ways.Warning: Currently the Integration settings cannot be accessed on the mobile app. Please use a PC or browser version for this.Note: People with the permission Administrator are unaffected by any restrictions and can always use all commands.You can find the Integration settings by going over to your Server Settings , then into the Integrations tab. Once here, locate the bot and click on Manage . Once in here, you can modify which users can use commands, which channels allow commands, as well as choose which commands are allowed to either channel or users. Text Commands (opts, game, etc.) Foreword Some commands currently still function the same way you have always used them (in text form). Notably these include opts, game and some currency commands. While this is not here to stay we would like to let you know how to manage them until they do inevitably vanish. Permissions Additionally, unlike with slash commands: Any permissions required by Mantaro, such as embed links, attach files, etc., are not explicitly obtained and will have to be granted in order for said commands to work. Usually it is not enough to grant them to the role itself if you have modified channel permissions. Disabling/Managing text Commands (Permission Method) Text commands abide by discord's channel permissions. If you would like Mantaro not to be used in a certain channel simply go to the channel's settings and then Permissions , under Advanced Permissions add or navigate to a role Mantaro has and deny it View Channel . This will cause all text commands to not work.Note: Denying view channel has no effect on Slash Commands.

As-well as you need at least a value and a name in each {}. Name will set what you see as \"Field name\" and value what you see as \"Field value\", inline will determine whether the field will be in a separate line (like the first one in the image) or next to an existing one. Inline can be either true or false or be omitted entirely. Field Syntax: [ {name:\"name of the first field\", value:\"value of the first field\", inline:true}, {name:\"name of the second field\", value:\"value of the second field\", inline:false} ] How to use an embed in custom commands? Please pay close attention to the character limits in the image above as-well as the maximum amount of fields. Exceeding those will make your custom command fail! You do not have to use all of the things above you can create your own combinations of them as you like. Additionally please note that title , author , field names and footer do not support any form of mentions due to discord limitations.Our syntax for the custom command will have to be @{embed;<json>} . With \"json\" being any assortment of the things you learned above. For instance: title:\"text\",description:\"text\" . (Note the comma between 2 variables)As an example we will build the embed above using Mantaro.

Additionally you can also use the compare operation to assert a boolean (true or false), uses for that are in the Asserting section down below. Syntax for this is @{compare;thing to compare;comparator;thing to compare with} . Available comparators equals : As seen in the example above will check if the thing to compare equals the thing to compare with. not-equals : Same as equals but reversed*. ignorecase-equals : Same as equals but ignores casing (i.e A == a). ignorecase-not-equals : Same as ignorecase-equals but reversed*. greater-than : Whether or not the thing to compare is greater than what the thing to compare with is (i.e 2 > 1). less-than :Whether or not the thing to compare is less than what the thing to compare with is (i.e 1 < 2). not-greater-than : Same as greater-than but reversed*. not-less-than : Same as less-than but reversed*. ignorecase-greater-than : Same as greater-than but ignores casing. ignorecase-less-than : Same as less-than but ignores casing. ignorecase-not-greater-than : Same as not-greater-than but ignores casing. ignorecase-not-less-than : Same as not-less-than but ignores casing. contains : Whether or not the thing to compare includes the thing to compare with. not-contains : Same as contains but reversed*. starts-with : Checks if the thing to compare starts with the thing to compare with. ignorecase-starts-with : Same as starts-with but ignores casing. ends-with : Checks if the thing to compare ends with the thing to compare with. ignorecase-ends-with : Same as ends-with but ignores casing. * Note: Reversed means logically reversed i.E contains checks if it is in the thing and not-contains checks if it is not in the thing. Predicting Predicting is the act of checking whether or not something meets a predicate. In simpler terms this can be anything like checking if a value is empty or checking if it's equal to a preset value.The syntax for if-else for this one is @{if;thing to predict;predicate;if met;if not met (else)} . You can additionally use the test operation to assert a boolean, uses for that are in the Asserting section down below. Syntax for this is @{test;predicate;value to predict} Available Predicates usermention : Check if the thing you check is a user mention. is-empty : Checks whether the thing to check is empty (aka has no characters). is-not-empty : Same as is-empty but reversed*. * Note: Reversed means logically reversed i.E contains checks if it is in the thing and not-contains checks if it is not in the thing. Asserting (True and False) Asserting a boolean means anything that returns a true or a false. We have mentioned the compare and test operations up above, both of these will when used outside of an if give you a \"true\" or a \"false\" as a message. However these truth values can be used in if commands to make more complex structures.The structure for if-else changes drastically for this one. It is as follows: @{if;if met;assertive;if not met} This all comes with very handy logical operators: @{and;operation;operation;....} : This can be used to only return true when all operations passed assert to true. @{or;operation;operation;....} : This can be used to return true when any of the operations passed assert to true. @{not;assertive} : This can be used to negate an assertive, meaning a true will become a false and vice versa. Operations You have a handful of operations to choose from, while we already talked about most of them, here is a list of all: @{if;syntax} : Used to make conditional responses, it's syntax is dependent on how it is used and all syntax are explained in the respective sections for predicting, comparing and asserting. @{not-empty;argument1;argument2;....} : Returns the first value that is not empty (You can feed this unlimited arguments). https://i.imgur.com/KRLgId2.png Example (Note: this does not ignore values that are only a space) @{not-empty-strict;argument1;argument2;....} : Same as not-empty but also considers values that are only a space to be empty. @{set;key;value} : Explained in detail in the Modifiers section up above @{embed;embed syntax} : Explained in detail in the embeds section up above @{compare;syntax} : Explained in detail in the comparing section up above @{test;syntax} : Explained in detail in the predicting section up above @{and;syntax} : Explained in detail in the asserting section up above @{or;syntax} : Explained in detail in the asserting section up above @{not;syntax} : Explained in detail in the asserting section up above @{timestamp;format;zone} : Used to print a time/date in any format you like from any timezone you like. Format is a bit more complex an example would be: d MMM uuuu , for the current date (more info for format on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/format/DateTimeFormatter.html Java Docs, the time zone can be any of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones these TZ database names (include every character even underlines). @{upper;text} : Used to convert a text to fully uppercase @{lower;text} : Same as upper but with lowercase @{replace;character(s) to replace;replace with;replace in} : Used for replacing occurrences of characters in a text. Example would be @{replace;r;test;$(event.message)} to replace all r's with test in event.message What do we get in v3 vs old v2 You can now nest ifs (i.E use a new if as else of another to create chains)! You can now use embed fields in ifs You can now use newlines in ifs You can now check whether or not something contains a discord mention You can now chain if's (use multiple ifs in the same command) and have their else actually work.

Credits The currency used in Mantaro is called Credits. The main purpose of the currency system is to collect Credits. Credits are necessary for many of the purchases in the currency system. Items Mantaro counts with over 100 items for users to collect and use. Some items are only meant to be collected, other items can bring bonuses to the user and other items can enable certain commands.

It is not necessary to know all items or to look into this page, but know that it can be a good resource in the future. Dust Sometimes a few of the currency commands will \"fail\" and won't give you credits or items. A lot of those times you will gather dust instead. A few commands gather dust when successfully used.

As you progress you will be able to create better tools. Durability Most tools at your disposal have a durability value. As you use your tools, this value will continue to drop until your tool breaks. Durability changes across each type of tool and its different tiers, meaning better tools have more durability. When your tool does break it will disappear. However, if the tool that broke has a broken item version, then you have ~80% chance of getting the broken version back. Not all tools have a broken version.After equipping your tools (see next section), you can check their durability by using /profile stats . null https://i.imgur.com/n8OdRl1.png image Equip and Unequip To keep going forward first off you will need to equip your new tools.

However, if you have used the item then two things can happen:If the tool you are unequipping has a broken version, then you will get the broken version back. If the tool you are unequipping doesn't have a broken version, then the tool will be lost, and you will get back some credits instead. null https://i.imgur.com/AdD7GPF.png image Mine Required Tool: Any Pickaxe.When you use /mine you will go mining to get credits and/or items.

They don't have a lot of durability, and their chance of getting items isn't that great. As you might have figured out by now, there are better tools available for you to use. In this section we'll try to teach you about these tools and how to get them.First things first, the different tool tiers. Not all tools have every single tier (meaning some skip a few tiers), but the order should still be the same.Default tools Diamond tools Comet tools Star tools Moon tools Sparkle tools Hellfire tools Each tier requires different materials to be created. The better the tool, the rarer the material. Some tools allow you as well to get items you were not able to get before. As well, the better the tool you use, the better the drop rate for items.Sparkle Fragments () can only drop if you use a Star tool or better. Shells () can only drop if you use a Comet tool or better. Sharks () can only drop if you use a Sparkle tool or better. Casting Before you start casting items you will need a new tool, a wrench. As with the previous tools, wrenches have different tiers. Different tiers are needed to cast different items, so you will need them eventually. Wrenches are different from other tools in that you don't need to equip them. Instead, you specify the wrench you want to use when you cast something. Name Icon [{text=Wrench, type=SimpleText}] For now go to market and get yourself a few of the default wrenches.You need to equip your wrench with the /equip command, just like you equip your pick, rod or axe.Casting is the main way in which you will be getting these new tools. You can start by viewing a list of all castable items with ~>cast list . Check out the items and look at the recipes and prices of each of them. To cast the item you can use /cast item item:<name> . For example, /cast item item:Comet Gem . null https://i.imgur.com/HBAvCxH.png image If you have a better wrench than the default one (which you can cast) you can also equip it to cast Items for cheaper as well as multiple items at once. To cast multiple items at once, put the amount before the item name (For example, /cast item item:Star Pickaxe amount:5 ).As we mentioned before, remember that if your dust level is too high you won't be able to cast. We explain how to clean your dust a bit further on the Potions section. If you don't know how to get an item then take a look at our https://github.com/Mantaro/MantaroBot/wiki/Item-Documentation Item Documentation page if you want to find out where exactly you can find the items you need. Repairing Sometimes when your tool breaks you will get a broken version back. With the repair command you can repair your broken tool to use it once again. Just as with cast, you will need a wrench to use this command. However, the default wrench from the market won't be enough, so cast yourself a better wrench before repairing. First off, check out the list of repairable items and their recipes with /repair list . You need to equip your wrench with the /equip command, just like you equip your pick, rod or axe. If you have one equipped, you don't need to worry.After you found the recipe to repair your broken tool you can use /repair item item:<name> Salvaging Sometimes you don't want to spend resources repairing a tool, or you simply don't have them. In those cases you might want to consider salvaging your tool. When you salvage a tool you randomly get back one of its components.

Transferitems/Transfer Chances are, unless you are alone in a server with a bot, there are other people in the server with you.

People were abusing this, and we had to introduce a transfer tax. Not long ago from the time of writing this (November 27, 2020) we performed a Currency reset to try to fix this issue. However, people still found ways to abuse the systems we have. For this reason, we decided to leave in the credit tax. As well, we made it so that you cannot transfer credits to or from a new Discord account. We also limited the max amount of credits you can transfer to 500,000 and increased considerably the ratelimit of the Transfer command.While these measures may disappear or be changed in the future, we feel the need to explain why they are there in the first place. We thank everyone for their understanding. Games Mantaro offers 3 types of games which can each earn you some credits. All the games below (except trivia) can be started using ~>game <type> . You can start multiple instances of a single game using ~>game multiple <type> <amount> . You can start multiple games in a lobby using ~>game lobby <types> for instance ~>game lobby pokemon, trivia . You can play with people by simply mentioning them at the very end of the command. Trivia Unlike the other game commands, trivia can be used with ~>trivia or ~>trivia <difficulty> where difficulty can be easy, medium or hard. However if you want to play multiple instances after another or have it be part of the lobby you would still refer to the above. (Note that appending the difficulty works on multiple and lobby as well using -diff <difficulty> )Trivia is essentially a game of answering the asked question. The difficulty you pick will determine how many credits you get. You get 2 attempts to solve normal questions and one for true and false questions. Due to technical limitations you may not specify a category. Pokeguess (Who is that pokemon) You can start this game with ~>game pokemon . Pokeguess is a simple game of being shown a silhouette of a specific pokemon (and sometimes a very specific form of it). You then get 4-5 attempts to guess the pokemon correctly. If you do, you will be rewarded a handful of credits. Number You can start this game with ~>game number . This is by far the hardest game. You will be asked to guess a number between 0 and 150 within 5 attempts and 30 seconds. You will get hints whether the number is lower or higher than you last guess. Guessing right will reward you a handful of credits. Character You can start this game with ~>game character . In this game you will be shown an anime character. You then get 4-5 attempts to guess either their full name, or their first name. Guessing correctly will grant you a handful of credits. Gamble Gamble is arguably the best for making fast money however it does come with a risk. The odds are not in your favor You can initiate a gamble by using /gamble amount:<amount> . The minimum amount is 100 credits, and the maximum is 10,000 credits. You can also type \"all\", \"half\" or \"quarter\" for the respective amount of your total credits (Assuming it falls in the range of credits given before). With a bit of luck you get to keep what you bet and win some extra credits, if you are out of luck you lose it all.\\ Slots Slot is very similar to gamble however it has a higher chance of winning at the cost of a lower reward. You can roll the slots using /slots credits:<amount> . The minimum amount is 25 credits, and the maximum is 50,000 credits. You can also make use of slot tickets which you can buy from the market.

Use of the Mantaro \"currency\" and game system","3.1. Data: You agree that all data you provide to the bot through commands and that specifically or implicitly means it will be saved forever, on a database located on a remote location.The information is highly confidential and won't be sold or used by any other purpose that's not specific to the functionality of the bot. 3.2. Usage and cheating/botting: Cheating and/or botting (using self-bots/user-bots/macros/auto-clickers on your account to gain unfair advantage) are completely prohibited. If you're caught botting or cheating on any of the currency commands your profile is on a high risk of being deleted from the database completely without warning. https://discord.com/terms Keep in mind this could get you banned from Discord as well as this is also against their ToS. 3.2.1. Macros: Keyboard macros are disallowed if they perform more than one command per keypress. If you have a macro to do /chop and then you have to press enter then that's ok, but if you do one that does \"chop -> enter -> mine -> enter -> loot\" then that's NOT okay, and it's considered botting. I get bored with typing /mine too sometimes, but don't run multiple commands with a single key press! That'll just get you flagged. 3.3. Re-incidences: If the end user continues to cheat on the games/currency commands, the account will be terminated, its data deleted without prior warning and the end user will be blocked from using the bot. 3.4. Appeals: It's possible to file a full appeal with the reasons on why you want to be unblocked from using the bot by sending an apology letter regarding the following points:The reason of why you cheated Why you won't cheat again Why should we trust you. 3.5. Money transfers: It's NOT allowed to exchange credits for real money. If you're caught doing this your profile is on a high risk of being deleted from the database completely without warning. This also comes into play if you're in a server who does that kind of transaction. This includes Discord Nitro trades, as some people just tend to send the money through PayPal. Anything that involves any kind of real money is utterly and completely prohibited. 3.6. Account deletion: We will delete your account and all the data associated with it on request, done through the support guild or by sending a DM to Kodehawa#3457. 3.7. Trading for other bots credits: This is usually considered a gray area and not encouraged. You're better off not doing this if you don't want to risk your account under any circumstances."],["legal@@terms-of-service@@4-premium-features","Legal","Terms Of Service","4.
